            <p>An allergic reaction occurs when the immune system overreacts to a normally harmless substance, such as certain foods, insect stings, medications, or environmental allergens. Symptoms can range from mild like hives, itching, or a runny nose, to severe such as difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat, dizziness, or a drop in blood pressure.<br><br>Severe allergic reactions are called anaphylaxis, which is a life-threatening medical emergency. Immediate treatment is critical. The first step is to use an epipen if avalible, which helps reverse the symptoms. After giving epinephrine, call emergency services immediately, as further medical treatment may be needed. If the person stops breathing or their heart stops, CPR should be started if trained to do so. People with severe allergies should always carry an epipen and inform those around them of their condition.<br><br>After administering an epipen and calling for emergency help, itâ€™s important to keep the person lying down with their legs elevated if possible, unless they are having trouble breathing; in that case, they should sit up slightly to make breathing easier. Even if the person starts to feel better, they must still go to the hospital for observation, as a second wave of symptoms, called biphasic anaphylaxis, can occur hours later. In addition to an epipen, healthcare providers may give antihistamines or steroids to help control symptoms, but these medications are not substitutes for an epipen. Education on recognising early signs of anaphylaxis, avoiding known allergens, and having an emergency action plan are key parts of preventing future life-threatening reactions.<br><br>In summary, allergic reactions can range from mild to life-threatening, with anaphylaxis being the most severe form. Epinephrine is the first and most important treatment for anaphylaxis, followed by immediate medical attention. Even if symptoms improve, hospital observation is necessary to ensure safety. Knowing how to recognize symptoms, avoiding triggers, and having an emergency plan can save lives.</p>
