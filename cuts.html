            <p>A laceration is a type of wound that occurs when the skin, and sometimes the underlying tissues, are torn or cut. It is typically caused by trauma from a sharp object (like glass or metal) or blunt force that splits the skin. Lacerations can vary in depth, length, and severity, and they may bleed heavily depending on the location and size.</p>
            <p>Treating a laceration with basic first aid involves a few important steps to stop the bleeding, prevent infection, and protect the wound. The first and most immediate action is to control any bleeding. Apply direct pressure to the wound using a clean cloth, gauze, or even your hand if necessary. Elevating the injured area above the level of the heart can also help reduce blood flow and slow bleeding.<br><br>Once the bleeding has slowed or stopped, the next step is to clean the wound. Gently rinse the area with clean water to remove dirt or debris. Avoid using hydrogen peroxide or iodine directly on the wound, as these can irritate tissue and slow healing. If there's any debris that can't be easily washed out, seek medical attention. After cleaning, gently pat the area dry with a clean cloth or sterile gauze. After cleaning the laceration, cover the wound with a sterile bandage or dressing to protect it from dirt and bacteria. If the wound is minor, an adhesive bandage may be enough. For deeper or longer cuts, sterile gauze and medical tape are better choices. Keeping the wound clean and dry is essential. Change the dressing daily, or more often if it becomes wet or dirty. You may apply a thin layer of antibiotic ointment to help prevent infection, unless the person is allergic to it.<br><br>If the laceration is deep, won't stop bleeding, or shows signs of infection (such as redness, swelling, pus, or increasing pain), seek medical attention. Additionally, wounds caused by dirty or rusty objects may require a tetanus shot if the person's immunization is not up to date. Proper first aid can significantly reduce the risk of complications and help ensure the wound heals properly.</p>
