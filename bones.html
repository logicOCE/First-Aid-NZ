            <p>Bone injuries involve damage to the structure of the bone and can include fractures, dislocations, bone bruises, and growth plate injuries. This guide only goes over fractures and dislocations. Fractures range from small cracks (stress fractures) to complete breaks, and can be closed (not breaking the skin) or open (piercing the skin). Dislocations happen when a bone is forced out of its joint. These injuries often cause pain, swelling, and limited movement, and usually require medical evaluation and treatment for proper healing.</p>
            <p>If you suspect someone has a fractured bone, the first priority is to immobilize the injured area. Do not attempt to straighten the bone. Use a splint or padded object to keep the area still, and support it with a sling if necessary. Apply ice wrapped in a cloth to reduce swelling and pain, but avoid placing ice directly on the skin. If there's bleeding, apply gentle pressure with a clean cloth without pressing on the bone itself. Keep the person as still and calm as possible, and seek medical help immediately.<br><br> In the case of a suspected dislocation, do not try to pop the joint back into place, as this can cause more damage. Instead, immobilize the joint in the position it's found and support it with a splint or sling. Apply ice to the area to reduce swelling and pain. Keep the person still and calm, and get medical attention promptly, as dislocations often involve damage to ligaments, nerves, or blood vessels. Only a trained professional should reposition a dislocated joint.<br><br>When dealing with a fracture or dislocation, it's important to keep the injured area immobilized and avoid trying to move or realign the bone or joint, as doing so can cause further damage. Apply ice wrapped in a cloth to reduce swelling and pain, and use a splint or sling for support if needed. Keep the person calm and still, and seek medical attention immediately to ensure proper treatment.</p>
