            <p>At First Aid NZ, our mission is simple: to empower everyday New Zealanders with essential first aid knowledge that can make a real difference in emergencies. Whether you're a parent, student, teacher, or just someone who wants to be more prepared, we're here to help you learn the basics of first aid—clearly, simply, and accessibly. This website was created to fill a gap: there's a lot of great first aid training out there, but sometimes people just want quick, reliable information without having to sign up for a formal course. That's where we come in. First Aid NZ offers general guidance on how to respond to common medical emergencies, from cuts and burns to anaphylaxis and broken bones. While the content here is not a substitute for professional training or certification, it's a great starting point for anyone wanting to build their confidence and understanding. Our goal is not only to inform but to encourage more Kiwis to take action—whether that means physically helping, or knowing when to call 111. The more people who know even a little bit of first aid, the safer and more resilient our communities become.</p>
