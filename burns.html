            <p>Burn wounds are injuries to the skin caused by heat, electricity, chemicals, or radiation. They are classified into three main types: first-degree burns (affecting only the outer layer of skin), second-degree burns (damaging deeper layers and often causing blisters), and third-degree burns (destroying all layers of the skin and sometimes underlying tissues).<br><br>Immediate treatment is crucial to reduce damage and prevent infection. For minor burns, the affected area should be cooled under cool (not cold) running water for at least 10-20 minutes, followed by gently covering it with a sterile, non-stick dressing. Avoid using ice to treat the burn. Pain relief can be managed with over-the-counter medications like paracetamol or ibuprofen.<br><br>For serious burns—those that are large, deep, or located on sensitive areas like the face or joints—seek emergency medical care immediately. Keeping burns clean, covered, and monitored for signs of infection is key during healing.  Never pop blisters or apply ointments, butter, or home remedies to severe burns, as they can cause infection or further damage. Proper burn care promotes healing, minimizes scarring, and helps prevent complications.<br><br>Burns can also cause shock in severe cases, especially if a large area of skin is affected. Signs of shock include pale, clammy skin, weakness, rapid breathing, or fainting, and require urgent medical care. Keeping the burned person warm (without overheating the burn) helps prevent shock. For chemical or electrical burns, professional medical help is always necessary, even if the injury looks small, because damage below the skin may not be immediately visible. Healing time depends on the severity and depth of the burn; minor burns may heal in days, while severe burns can take weeks or months and might need specialized treatment or surgery.</p>
