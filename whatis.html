            <p>First aid is the immediate care given to a person who has been injured or suddenly becomes ill before professional medical help arrives. It involves simple, often life-saving techniques such as stopping bleeding, performing CPR, treating burns, or managing shock. The main goals of first aid are to preserve life, prevent the condition from worsening, and promote recovery. It can be administered by anyone with basic training and is an essential skill that can make a critical difference in emergencies, whether at home, at work, or in public settings.<br><br>In addition to providing immediate care, first aid also helps reduce the risk of complications and supports the healing process. Knowing how to properly assess a situation and respond calmly can prevent panic and ensure the injured person receives appropriate attention until medical professionals take over. First aid training often includes learning how to recognize the signs of common medical emergencies like heart attacks, strokes, allergic reactions, and choking. It also teaches the importance of using protective equipment, such as gloves, to avoid infection or contamination. Overall, first aid empowers individuals to act confidently and responsibly in critical situations, potentially saving lives and improving outcomes.<br><br>First Aid NZ is dedicated to equipping the public with essential, life-saving first aid skills.
